Chef's Hat is a card game where your goal
is to discard all cards before the other players do.
The cards have values from 1 to 11. 
There is one card of
value 1, two cards of value 2, and so on up to 11.
In other words, lower cards are rarer 
and higher cards are more common. 
They are randomly distributed 
among the four players. 
Each Player can only discard 
cards of a single value per move. 
In order to discard them, the 
cards must be of lower value than the cards
that are currently on the 
board and in the same or greater quantity. 
For instance, if the board has 
Q cards of value C, you must play at
least Q cards of at least value C-1. 
If you don't have an specific card
but have 1 or 2 Jokers you can use
them as a wildcard that replaces them. 
If you don't have any cards that
can be played you are forced to pass
your move, which lowers
your chances of winning.
